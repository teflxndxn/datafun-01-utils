source .venv/bin/activate

# For Windows (use this instead)
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Blessing Analytics - Company Byline

## Project Overview
This Python module showcases my (hypothetical) analytics consulting company, Blessing Analytics. It demonstrates how I can use Python variables, f-strings, and basic statistics to generate useful bylines for analytics projects. This code is reusable across various projects.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to:
- Create a reusable byline showcasing the core values of the analytics company
- Practice Python syntax, including variables, data types, and f-strings
- Perform basic statistical calculations like mean, standard deviation, and range

## Features
- Customizable company byline with variables for international clients, years in operation, skills offered, and client satisfaction scores
- Utilizes Pythonâ€™s `statistics` library to calculate minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation of client satisfaction scores
- Prints a professional company byline to the console

## Project Files
1. **utils_bless.py** - Contains the code for generating the company byline, defining variables, and calculating statistics.
2. **main.py** - A script that calls the functions from `utils_bless.py` to print the byline.
3. **README.md** - This file that explains the project details.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up and activate a virtual environment.
3. Install any necessary dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
